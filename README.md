Edifice Maps
===================

Simple Sinatra site showcasing maps of Chicago's built environment, made with building data from Edifice database. More info [here](http://edifice.opencityapps.org).

We designed the maps using [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/) for the 
[Reinventing Chicago Hackathon](http://www.cnt.org/events/reinventing-chicago/), October 6-8 2012 in Chicago.

Want to see how the sausage was made? TileMill projects can be found [here](https://github.com/open-city/edifice-maps-tilemill).

We borrowed the [site template](http://mapbox.com/reinventgreen/) and map styles from the wonderful folks at [Mapbox](http://mapbox.com/).
